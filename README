## Accessing Training Data

Training files can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson/data).

However, you do not need to download the data manually. The following code will handle accessing the data for you:

```python
data_dir = KaggleDatasets().get_gcs_path('higgs-boson-dataset')
print(tf.io.gfile.listdir(data_dir))
