Detecting the Higgs Boson File using Kaggle's TPUs.
by GBG7

This was made using Kaggles's TPUs. Upload the `.ipynb` file onto Kaggle, visit Settings>Accelerator> and select TPUVM3-8.

This works for the latest version of Tensorflow V2.18.0 (Various other guides only work for TF 2.10.0).
I updated the code myself.

Training Files can be found (here)[https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson/data]. However, 
```
data_dir = KaggleDatasets().get_gcs_path('higgs-boson-dataset')
print(tf.io.gfile.listdir(data_dir))
``` will handle accessing the data for you, so there is no need to download the data.
